# RGB-Color-Game
-----The RGB color guessing game-----

This is basically my first little project after learning JavaScript and I have made this totally on my own.
This is a color guessing game, you have given a RGB value of any random color and you have to guess the color. The game has to modes for now EASY(contains 3 grids) and HARD(cotains 6 grids). I will work on the layout in the upcoming days and will make it more eye-catching.

*NOTE-- Open it in CHROME browser.
